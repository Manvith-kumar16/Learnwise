Let's assume (Pos + 2) then (Pos + 4) then (Pos). BLUE: B(2)+2=4, L(12)+4=16, U(21)+2=23, E(5)+4=9. No match. If (Pos-1)*(Pos): No. Let's assume the digits are: R=20, E=09, D=4. B=2, L=12, U=21, E=5. B+2=4. L+4=16. U+2=23. E+4=9. (416239). The answer implies B=4, L=16, U=21, E=25 (Pos+4). BLUE = B(2)+4=6 $\ne 16$. **Assume direct letter position with a common typo:** B(2) $\to 4$ (Wrong). Let's use the given answer's logic: **162125** implies $B=16, L=21, U=25$. No positional sense. **Rethink lr21 logic (Pos $\times 2$):** $R(18) \times 2 = 36$. BLUE $\to 4 \times 2 = 8$. This is a flawed question in the provided set. Using $R\to 20, E\to 09, D\to 4$. The correct answer logic is likely missing. Choosing 3 as the intended key for the flawed question.",
